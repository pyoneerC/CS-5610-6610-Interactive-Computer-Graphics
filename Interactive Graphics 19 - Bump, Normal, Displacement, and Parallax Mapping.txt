PRETRUDING SURFACE NORMAL. bumps from the side at angle :) from above at angle :(  fake af. except displacement

BUMP MAPPING:

bump mapping > add geometric details without any geometry, without generating any triangles. 
I think the best way to understand bump mapping is to think of it as a way to add detail to a surface without actually changing the geometry of the surface. 
it achieve this by playing with the normals of the objects. there interpolated. not changing geometry, changing normals.
the bumbmap is a greyscale. black is down, white is up. (height map)
tessalated is very similar to bump map, bump map normally preserves shapes, dont deform, we need warping with it.
bump mapping = cheap detail. realistic. looks much high res and worked than it actually is. take surface normal and tweak it a bit depending on the bump map. lerp. basically.
you need to know how the heightmap changes, not just one value. based on that we modify, thats a bit expensive and annoying. we require a little bit more data than 1 point for a sweet lerp.
we can store normals directly, im using height to find normal

NORMAL MAPPING:

newer, instead of pretruding at runtime by bumb map we precompute them by RGB scale. more exagerated, more control, more detail.
i read any point and gives me the surface normal normal values will be on a sphere, normalized. local space.
tangent and bitagent calculates with uv coordinates. red is preturbe on x, green is y, purple is z (in the normal map)
normal mapping works well with small details, but not with large details. the ilusion breaks.
used in offline render engines.  doing the orange instead of normal mapping would be a pain. faking geometry.
we can edit textures in photoshop.

bump map vs normal map: different. heightmap and normal map looks same. with bumb - HEIGHT TO NORMAL . with normal - RGB TO NORMAL (more freedom, new). Use normal maps. two different ways to modify the normals for shading.
in some angles this effect breaks.

DISPLACEMENT MAPPING: (involves tessalation). we need to modify SURFACE NORMALS && VERTICES. SO WE GOT DISPLACEMENT (VERTS) + NORMAL MAP (NORMALS). if not normal youll need to calculate at runtime.
displacement map corresponds to the geometry i have, if we pump it off nothing happens . more res normal map better normals, indpeendent on geoemtric details.

the more realistic and controllable, but its real performance struggle.
heightmap! (or rgb for 3 axis, tangent, binormal) map but actually changes the geometry, actually a high res model. tessalation. more expensive. we can work from this real mesh. we need this for terrain for example, as we cant fake it.
small details - normal map. large, real details - displacement map.

PER PIXEL DISPLACEMENT MAPPING. OFFLLINE. APPLY DISPLACEMENT MAPPING, ZOOM, AND ALL GEOMETRIC DETAIL TO THE RES OF THE DISPLACEMENT`!!!!!!!!! EXPERNSIVE AF.
PARALLAX MAPPING: (not used anymore). fake 3d effect. not used anymore. not realistic.
similar to per pixel but approximation the displacement maps without new geometry, not paying the full cost of per pixel displacement. cheap. using lenght from dusplacement map and camera vector.
approximating displaced surface w camera vector and fown vector, and straight. if you rotate the paralaxed map, it will break. not used anymore. distorted because its aN APPROXIMATION. cheap trick.
steep parallel mapping: stepping, paralalx mapping but with limit between points. 0.0 > 1.0 goes to all steps, not as efficient. stop when i went far enough. better aproxximiation. stepping until we find the point w mesh. multiple reades, its shit expensive. still breaks rotating
PARALLEX OCCLUSION MAPPING: STEEP + 1 STEP. APPROXIMATE LAST 2 POINTS FLATNESS. APRROXIMATES THE ACCUARATE MIDPOINT. SMOOTH OVER. THE BEST, THE MORE EXPENSIVE. PER PIXEL. STEEP + APPROXIMATION OF POINTS.
PARALLAX MAPPING IN SURFACES FOR STAIRS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) ELDER SCROOLS PARALAX MAPPING IN WALLS ULTRA DETAIL. VERY PERFECT == UNREALISTIC. SHADOW + PARALLEX OCCLUSION MAPPING. PARAALX MAPPING COMO UN VIDRIO

YOU CAN SEE MUL;TIPLE STEPS IN STEEP AND OCCLISOM PARALLAX. MORE STEPS THE BETTER.
